# rock-paper-scissors

This is a terminal based game rock paper scissors made using Python.
I have made this game in two formats:
1. Play with Computer (for people who are playing alone)
2. Pass n Play (for two players)

Talking about future scope of this project. 
1. I am thinking to make GUI for this game.
2. Making multiplayer options.
3. Making Pass n Play for more than 2 players.
